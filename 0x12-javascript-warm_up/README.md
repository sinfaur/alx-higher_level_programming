# JavaScript - Warm Up

---

In this project, we start the journey of exploring the world of JavaScript--the multi-purpose
scripting language. The aim of this project is the be able to answer the following questions
using code solutions:

- Why is JavaScript programming?
- How can a JavaScript script be run?
- How are variables and constants created?
- What are the differences between `var`, `const` and `let`?
- What are all the data types available in JavaScript?
- How are the `if`, `if ... else` statements used?
- How are comments used?
- How are values affected to variables?
- How do `while` and `for` loops work in JavaScript?
- How are `break` and `continue` statements used?
- What is a function and how do you use functions?
- What does a function that does not use any return statement return?
- What is the Scope of a variable?
- What are the arithmetic operators and how are they used?
- How are dictionaries manipulated?
- How are files imported in JavaScript?

> For all `.js` files, linting is done using [semistandard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard).
