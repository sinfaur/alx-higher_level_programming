# Python - Network #1

Python is a language with a great support for network programming. In this project,
we use the package [urllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html) to write
short network requests. The aim of the project ultimately is learning:

- How to fetch internet resources with the Python package `urllib`
- How to decode `urllib` body response
- How to use the Python package `requests` implemented by `urllib`
- How to make HTTP `GET` request
- How to make HTTP `POST`, `PUT` etc. request
- How to fetch JSON resources
- How to manipulate data from an external service
