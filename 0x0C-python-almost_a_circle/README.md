# Python - Almost a Circle

---

A Python project that helps to teach how to carry out unittests in a project with
a fairly large code base.
The aim of this project was to answer the following questions using code solutions:

- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project?
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class?
- How to write and read a JSON file?
- What is `*args` and how to use it?
- What is `**kwargs` and how to use it?
- How to handle named arguments in a function?
