"""The ``101-stats`` module

A script that parses logs based on a given input and prints to `stdout`

Input format:
`IP Address` - [`date`] "GET /projects/260 HTTP/1.1" `status code` `file size`

Each 10 lines and after a `KeyboardInterrupt` prints the following stats:
    Total file size in the format:
        File size: `total size`
    where `total size` is the sum of all previous sizes

    Number of lines by status code:
        possible status code: 200, 301, 400, 401, 403, 404, 405 and 500
        If a status code doesnâ€™t appear, nothing is printed for the code
        Status codes are printed in ascending order
        Format:
            `status code`: `number of occurences`
