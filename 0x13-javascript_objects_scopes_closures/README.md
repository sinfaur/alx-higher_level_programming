# JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

---

This project contains codes which answer the following questions in JavaScript:

- How can objects be created in JavaScript?
- What is `this` in JavaScript?
- What does `undefined` mean?
- Why is a variable's type and scope important?
- What is closure in JavaScript?
- What is a prototype in JavaScript?
- How can one object be inherited from another?

> Linting on all `.js` files was done using [semistandard](https://github.com/standard/semistandard).
