# Python - Exceptions

In this project, we were mandated to develop codes that handle exceptions during
program execution. The main objectives of the project are, but not limited to, answering
the following questions;

- Why Python programming is awesome?
- What’s the difference between errors and exceptions?
- What are exceptions and how to use them?
- When do we need to use exceptions?
- How can an exception be correctly handled?
- What’s the purpose of catching exceptions?
- How can a builtin exception be raised?
- When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception?

_NB: Task for [103-python.c](https://github.com/chee-zaram/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/main/0x05-python-exceptions/103-python.c)
needed us to three functions that print some basic info about Python lists,
Python bytes, and Python float objectives_.
