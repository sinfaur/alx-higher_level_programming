# Python - Everything is Object

---

In this project, we try to understand the extent to which everything in Python is
an object. The files in this directory contain code solutions to tasks that aim
to help answer the following questions:

- Why Python programming is awesome?
- What is an object?
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance?
- What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object?
- What is a reference?
- What is an assignment?
- What is an alias?
- How to know if two variables are identical?
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object?
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)?
- What is mutable and immutable?
- What are the built-in mutable types?
- What are the built-in immutable types?
- How does Python pass variables to functions?
