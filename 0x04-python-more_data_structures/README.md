# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
***
***
This directory contains solutions to mini tasks that help strengthen understanding of Python concepts such as **Set**, **Dictionary**, **lambda**, **map**, **reduce**, and **filter** functions. Tasks required us to write:
* a function that computes the square value of all integers of a 2D matrix, where the initial matrix is not modified.
* a function that replaces all occurences of an element by another in a new list.
* a function that adds all unique in a list.
* a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
* a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
* a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
* a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys assuming all keys are strings, keys should be sorted.
* a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
* a function that deletes a key in a dictionary, where key will always be a string.
* a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2, assuming all values are integers.
* a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value, assuming all values are integers and no two students will have the same score.
* a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using loops.
* Technical interview preparation: create a function that converts a number in Roman numeral to an integer value assuming the number will be between 1 to 3999.
* a function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple of the format **(\<score\>, \<weight\>)**. If list is empty, return 0.
* a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using **map** without modifying the original matrix, and without using loops, with file being 3 lines max.
* a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
