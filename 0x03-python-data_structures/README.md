# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
***
Working on solutions for tasks in this project help answer the following questions:
***
* Why is Python programming awesome?
* What are lists and how are they used?
* What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists?
* What are the most common methods of lists and how are they used?
* How are lists used as stacks and queues?
* What are list comprehensions and how are they used?
* What are tuples and how are they?
* When to should tuples be used versus lists?
* What is a sequence?
* What is tuple packing?
* What is sequence unpacking?
* What is the del statement and how is it used?
***
Technical interview preparation: Write a C function that checks if a listint_t list is a palindrome.
***
* We were not allowed to use any search engine and had to whiteboard first.
* An empty list is considered a palindrome.
***
An advanced C task required us to learn about PyObject and then write a C function that:
* Prints the size of a Python list
* Prints the number of allocations made
* All the elements type in the list
